Feature: Create articles
  As a journalist,
  In order to write articles
  I would like to be able to have an article creation form

  Background:
    Given the following user exists
    | first_name  | last_name    | email          | password | role      | id |
    | Hanna       | Nyman        | hanna@tuna.se  | password | journalist| 1  |
    | William     | Schneiderman | will@gmail.com | password | member    | 2  |
    And the following categories exists
    |name    |
    |Sports  |
    |Politics|
    |Health  |

    When I am logged in as "hanna@tuna.se"
    And I click "My account"
    And I click "New Article"
    Then I am on Create article page
